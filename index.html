    <h1>‚ú®Wednesday, February 5, 2025‚ú®</h1>
    <p class="header">
        Another quote I found on Facebook that resonated so much with me.
        <br />
        Sorry they're not my words, but that doesn't make them any less true for
        me.
        <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
        Chris, this is you.
        <br />
        Thank you for loving me the way that you do. It is transformative.
    </h3>
    <p>
        One day, you will meet a person who loves you with so much kindness and
        respect that it'll feel almost unfamiliar. They'll look at you with eyes
        that see all of you--your flaws, your scars, your stories--and they'll
        still choose you, wholeheartedly.
        <br /><br />
        You'll start to let go of the fear that's held you back from trusting
        someone again. The hurt you carried, the doubts you whispered to yourself
        late at night, and the walls you built to protect your heart will begin to
        crumble, not because someone forced them down, but because love, in its
        purest form, doesn't need to fight for space--it earns it through patience
        and understanding.
        <br /><br />
        This person will show up in your life when you least expect it, reminding
        you that the right connection doesn't drain you; it nourishes you. Their
        laughter will fill your quiet moments with joy, and their presence will
        feel like sunlight warming the coldest corners of your soul.
        <br /><br />
        They might not have all the perfect words or grand gestures [<span
        style="font-size: 16px"
        ><em>except in your case, you pretty much nail that one</em></span
        >], but they will love with sincerity. Their tenderness, their willingness
        to stay when things aren't easy, and their simple, quiet warmth will make
        you realize that true love isn't complicated--it's safe, it's gentle, and
        it makes your heart feel at home.
        <br /><br />
